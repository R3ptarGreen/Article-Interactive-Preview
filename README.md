## My Process

### Built with

- React
- Vite React Bundler
- Eslint & Prettier workflow
- JavaScript (DOM)
- CSS & sass/SCSS - styles
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM method
- Flexbox
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- .JSON and DevDependence

### What I Learned

If you want to import with Sass, you need to use a dependency in your package.json:

{
"sass": {
"load_path": [".src/SCSS"] In this case, mi path was this; in your case, it may be different.
}
}

### Continued Development

This project reflects most of my tools as a developer, I used learned techniques, and it reflects my acquired knowledge and my way of solving problems. I still need more practice; I am currently practicing React and I want to add it to my toolbox soon
